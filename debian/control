Description: Provides hierarchical representation of the code in as fragments.
 cdm-flowparser takes a file with a python code (or a character buffer), parses
 it and provides back a hierarchical representation of the code in terms of
 fragments.
 Each fragment describes a portion of the input content:
 a start point (line, column and absolute position) plus an end point
 (line, column and absolute position).
 Comments are preserved too.
 The parser is used in the Codimension Python IDE to generate a flowchart like
 diagrams for an arbitrary Python code as the user types it. Basically a pause
 in typing is detected and the diagram is regenerated.
