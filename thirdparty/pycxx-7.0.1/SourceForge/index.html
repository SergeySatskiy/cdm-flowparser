<h1>PyCXX is designed to make it easier to extend Python with C++</h1>

<p>
CXX/Objects is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier
to write Python extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier
to write Python extensions is that it greatly increases the probability
that your program will not make a reference-counting error and will not
have to continually check error returns from the Python C API. CXX/Objects
integrates Python with C++ in these ways:
<p>
<ul>

<li>
C++ exception handling is relied on to detect errors
and clean up. In a complicated function this is often a tremendous problem
when writing in C. With PyCXX, we let the compiler keep track of what objects
need to be dereferenced when an error occurs.</li>

<li>

The Standard Template Library (STL) and its many algorithms
plug and play with Python containers such as lists and tuples.
</li>

<li>
The optional CXX/Extensions facility allows you to replace the clumsy C tables with objects
and method calls that define your modules and extension objects.
</li>
</ul>

<p>PyCXX documentation is split into <a href="PyCXX-Python3.html">Python 3</a>
and <a href="PyCXX-Python2.html">Python 2</a> versions. The Python 3 documentation is the most accurate.</p>
