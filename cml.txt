CML - Codimension Markup Language

The language uses python comment strings to inject additional information.
This information can be used in different ways, e.g.:
- provide hints of how to display control flow
- provide additional links on diagrams
- suggest colors for code blocks
- etc.

Common format of the CML statements is as follows:

# cml <version> <record type> <key=value pairs>
or
# cmlcont <continue of a previous 'cml' line>

where:
- <version> is a CML version as integer, e.g. 1
- <record type> is a record type identifier. Usually it is a few characters
  code, e.g. SB

Key=value pairs are space separated. If the value contains spaces or needs to
be split between several lines then the value should be taken into double
quotes (" character). Double quote inside such a value must be escaped with \
character. CML supports C/C++ style glueing double quoted values.

If a cml line needs to be continued then the '# cmlcont' prefixed comment line
should be used. The continuation line must immediately follow the previous line.
Empty lines before '# cmlcont' lines are not allowed. There could be many
'# cmlcont' lines.

CML version 1 supports the following record types:
SB - scope begin record. It must have scope id (alpha numeric literal) in the
     list of values. The 'title' value is also recognized and will be used
     in a box which represents the scope.
     The SB record supposes that there must be an SE record further in the
     code with matching id.
SE - scope end record. It must have matching id.

The end of records is implicit. It is an absence of the '# cmlcont' record at
the next line.



Example of a single line scope record:

# cml 1 SB id=1234 title="Calculation of a checksum"

...
Some python code
...

# cml 1 SE id=1234


The same as multilined record:

# cml 1 SB id=1234
# cmlcont title="Calculation of"
# cmlcont       " a checksum"

...
Some python code
...

# cml 1 SE id=1234


Candidates for the other record types:
- WL link to a web resource
- FS local file system resource
- BC background color for the further code blocks
