CML - Codimension Markup Language

The language uses python comment strings to inject additional information.
This information can be used in different ways, e.g.:
- provide hints of how to display control flow
- provide additional links on diagrams
- suggest colors for code blocks
- etc.

Common format of the CML statements is as follows:

# cml <version ID> <record type> [all the rest]

where:
- <version ID> is a CML version as integer, e.g. 1
- <record type> is a record type identifier. Version 1 supports the following
  records:
  SB - scope begin record. It must have UUID as the first item in the
       [all the rest] part. The rest is the text which resides in the box
       representing the scope. If this record is found then there must be a
       paired SE record (see below)
  C  - continue of a previous record. This allows to have multilined records of
       any type.
  SE - scope end record. It must have UUID as the first item in the
       [all the rest] part. The UUID must match the one in the pair SB record

The end of records is implicit. It is an absence of the 'C' record at
the next line.



Example of a single line scope record:

# cml 1 SB 1234-123456-123456-1234 Calculation of a checksum

...
Some python code
...

# cml 1 SE 1234-123456-123456-1234


The same as multilined record:

# cml 1 SB 1234-123456-123456-1234
# cml 1 C Calculation of a checksum

...
Some python code
...

# cml 1 SE 1234-123456-123456-1234


Candidates for the other record types:
- WL link to a web resource
- FS local file system resource
- BC background color for the further code blocks
